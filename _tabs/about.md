My name is Siyu Liu and I am a machine learning PhD student currently studying at the University of Queensland. I am a rapid problem solver, and I enjoy developing machine learning models and algorithms based on state-of-the-art research. My areas of interest include 

- General purpose **computer vision** and **medical image analysis**
- **Transformers** for different types of ML tasks
- **Reinforcement learning**
- Machine learning for **finance** and **stock trading / investing**

I take a project-based learning approach where I implement most of the algorithms I learn. This site has been created to document and share my learning.
